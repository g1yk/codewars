  Title:
    Friend or Foe?
  Description:
    Make a program that filters a list of strings and returns a list with only your friends name in it.
    If a name has exactly 4 letters in it, you can be sure that it has to be a friend of yours! Otherwise, you can be sure he's not...
  Examples:
    Input = ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Jason", "Yous"]
    Output = ["Ryan", "Yous"]
  Notes:
    Keep the original order of the names in the output.
